## The Task
As an individual who has been contracted by the editors of a hypothetical food magazine entitled, "Eat Safe, Love," we are tasked to evaluate ratings data to assist journalists and food critics make better informed decisions on where they should focus their efforts in regards to future articles. One of the contributing factors with this is that the UK Food Standards Agency Evaluates business in the United Kingdom and gives them food hygiene ratings. In order to complete this task, we have to first setup a NoSQL database using a provided JSON file entitled establishments.json and the provided starter code which outlines a format that we should follow to accomplish this task. After setting this up, we then have to update the database. After that we are tasked with completing an exploratory analysis. 

## Navigating this repository
You can find a the code for this repository in the final_Code folder. This folder holds the completed code as well as a resources folder which contains the establishments.json file. 

## Data Provided
For this tasks we were provided starter code that contains two jupyter notebooks. The first NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb is where we setup and update the database. The second NoSQL_analysis_starter is where we are expected to perform the analysis. In the file download there was also a _MACOSX folder that was provided, but I believe that it may have been provided in error from the bootcamp as it came with the initial file download of the starter code. I have since removed that folder. We were also provided the establisments.json file which has all of the data for the establishments that we are working with in our database. 

## Code Sources
The code in this repository was sourced from starter code provided by the bootcamp as well as from in-class work and activities, stack overflow, and documentation libraries for VBA for certain aspects of this challenge. At times I did have to utilize google for simple queries and information as well as the PyMongo documentation in order to see how to manipulate the databases. I also had to make use of w3 schools for reference.
